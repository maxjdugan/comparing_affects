<h3>How do affects attach?</h3>

<p>This workshop calls for projects that re-examine the formation of solidarities, animosities, and hierarchies through the attachment of affects. [1]</p>

<p>Emotions attach as power. The force of sticky, compulsive, and pleasurable affect binds things–feelings like shame might clump bodies together into fleeting partnerships or bond them into lasting solidarities. But emotions also get attached to bodies; affects are conditioned, projected, and translated by relations of power. Anti-Blackness might bind fear to racialized subjects or a settler colonial war machine may convert grief into power. How might attention to these and other affective attachments (see “Potential Forms of Attachment”) help us create more reparative knowledge about power? [2]</p>

<p>We learn about the attachment of affects through method. Forging critical methods for affect theory can clarify the specificities, historicities, and material stakes of affective attachment–including those of public discourse and scholarly inquiry. How specifically do we read emotions in our research? How do we feel affects in our fieldwork? How do we measure affect in our datasets? How do the specifics of our data—the situatedness of good feelings, the physiology of fear, or the context of intensity—reveal the entanglement of power with affects? [3]</p>

<p>Workshop presentations should focus on the details of power and method. We invite submissions to this workshop to consider:</p> 

<li>How are particular bodies, places, or ideas attached to affects like grief, rage, joy, and hope? For whom do they produce value, and who labors for their production? What forms of violence, domination, and/or resistance does attachment form?</li>
<li>What methods must we develop to analyze the attachment of affects? How do affective attachments shape our methods? </li>
<li>WWhat structures of feeling can be mobilized to build collectivities or compel publics? How do these affective attachments work in the service of transformation?</li>

<p>The <a href="https://maxjdugan.github.io/comparing_affects/about">2023 inaugural Comparing Affects Workshop</a> invited 20 scholars to discuss methods for studying affect theory and the politics of comparing affects. The 2025 series invites scholars to consider approaches to the attachment of affects and their connections to power. This biennial workshop will take place virtually on <b>February 22, 2025</b>.</p>

<p>Applicants may submit a 300-word abstract, which describes your project, its method, and its relationship to affective attachments, to: <a href="http://bit.ly/attachingaffects">bit.ly/attachingaffects</a>. The application deadline is <b>December 9, 2024</b>. Your project should be suitable for a 15-minute presentation. Works-in-progress are welcome.
