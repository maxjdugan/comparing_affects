<h3>A Paternal Rhythm of 2023 Turkish Elections: Using Sentiment, Fantasy of Wealth & Heroic Kitsch</h3>

<p>My proposed contribution to this workshop comes with a discussion of affects through election slogans on billboards at the wake of 2023 general elections in Turkey. The upcoming election has encouraged political parties to take up space anew on billboards, posters and flamas hanging down bridges, on streets and pavements.  Of course, the election campaigns are never limited to visual sphere; however, I am interested in how desperate billboards aim to touch the voter audience by poking certain affects. Posts on the billboards use an eclectic mix of affects to wishfully emphasize freedoms,  national unity, while their audience is swimming in a wide current of financial affects that colonize their future. Why do political campaigners hold a naive belief in their promise despite the disconnect between their policies and the actual population, I ask. For example, such billboard campaigning is targeting youth as first-time voters with more Internet and flawless bandwidth, or, they underline tribute to national sentiments against refugees with criminal prospects. This is an forming-up research, while the intense pre-elections period is still to come in the first half of 2023.  My former research included an analysis of affective political sphere through street music, and now I problematize an affective political channel in billboardâ€™s colonizing imagery: what is the value of using that frame for stale,  unrealistic, unsound promises at a time of financial hardship, which tells a peculiar story of money and affect?</p>
