<h3>How do Affects Compare?</h3>

<p>This workshop explored this and other questions, namely:</p>
<li>What would a rigorous method of comparing affects look like? And how might it differ across disciplines and data types (e.g., sounds, sights, texts)?</li>
<li>How do power asymmetries shape the measurement, detection, and tracing of some affects against others?</li>
<li>What forces make an affect “work” in some cases and “fail” in others? What makes affects emancipatory or oppressive (or a combination of both)?</li>
<li>What affective comparisons are already embedded in theories of affect and power?</li>
<li>What can affective comparisons do for decolonial, postcolonial, and/or antiracist projects?</li>

<h3>Thanks!</h3>
<p>We (Heather Radwan Jaber and Max Johnson Dugan) couldn't have done this without the support of several people and entities. Principal among them is <b>Donovan O. Schaefer</b>, who has not only been an extraordinarily generous teacher and mentor, but also gave incisive feedback on various elements of the workshop. <b>Emily Ganser</b> was instrumental throughout the design process--most any good aspect of the posters was their doing. <b>Cassandra Hradil</b> was also an brilliant interlocutor for the website design. May we do justice to the support these individuals offered the workshop.</p>

<p>Many thanks to our co-sponsors for spreading the word about this workshop to their networks and for trusting us to further their important work. They are: at the <b>University of Pennsylvania</b>, the <b>Department of Religious Studies</b>, the <b>South Asia Center</b>, the <b>Center for Advanced Research in Global Communications</b>, the <b>Center on Digital Culture and Society</b>, the <b>Middle East Center</b>, and the <b>Center for Africana Studies,</b>and at <b>Northwestern Qatar</b>: the <b>Institute for Advanced Study in the Global South</b>.
